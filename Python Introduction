Python – an open source, versatile and powerful programming language. 

Python is one of those rare languages, which can claim to be both simple and powerful. 
You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the 
solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language you are programming in.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structure 
and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. It is an interpreted, object-oriented,
high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes 
readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, 
which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after the BBC show 
"Monty Python's Flying Circus". He doesn't particularly like snakes that kill animals for food 
by winding their long bodies around them and crushing them.
